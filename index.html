	<h1>AC/DC</h1>
	</div>


	<h2>AC/DC's mammoth power-chord roar became one of the most influential hard rock sounds of the '70s and helped define the style as the years progressed. Founded by Scottish-born brothers Malcolm and Angus Young, the Aussie band exploded onto the international stage in 1979 with the release of their multi-platinum-selling sixth album, Highway to Hell. The death of charismatic frontman Bon Scott in 1980 threatened to derail the group, but AC/DC powered through. They recruited Geordie vocalist Brian Johnson and unleashed their most successful effort to date, Back in Black, which has become the second best-selling album in history. The band spawned countless imitators over the next two decades and enjoyed commercial success well into the 2000s, with 2020's Power Up debuting at number one on multiple charts.</h2>

	<center><p>Livin' easy<br>
Lovin' free<br>
Season ticket on a one way ride<br>
Askin' nothin'<br>
Leave me be<br>
Takin' everythin' in my stride<br>
Don't need reason<br>
Don't need rhyme<br>
Ain't nothin' that I'd rather do<br>
Goin' down<br>
Party time<br>
My friends are gonna be there too<br>
I'm on the highway to hell<br>
On the highway to hell<br>
Highway to hell<br>
I'm on the highway to hell<br>
No stop signs<br>
Speed limit<br>
Nobody's gonna slow me down<br>
Like a wheel<br>
Gonna spin it<br>
Nobody's gonna mess me around<br>
Hey satan<br>
Payin' my dues<br>
Playin' in a rockin' band<br>
Hey mumma<br>
Look at me<br>
I'm on the way to the promised land<br>
I'm on the highway to hell<br>
Highway to hell<br>
I'm on the highway to hell<br>
Highway to hell<br>
Don't stop me<br>
I'm on the highway to hell<br>
On the highway to hell<br>
Highway to hell<br>
I'm on the highway to hell<br>
(Highway to hell) I'm on the highway to hell<br>
(Highway to hell) highway to hell<br>
(Highway to hell) highway to hell<br>
(Highway to hell)<br>
And I'm goin' down<br>
All the way<br>
I'm on the highway to hell</p>
